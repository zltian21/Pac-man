### Run JUnit Test  
If you need to run the JUnit Test do the following:  
1. find the [map.txt] file in the project folder. (peer to [pac-man-backend] and [pac-man-frontend])  
2. place the [map.txt] file in the [pac-man-backend] folder. (peer to [src] and [target])  
3. then you can run the JUnit Test. (Put the map.txt file back if you want to run the Application)
